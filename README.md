## Introduction

Asynchronous programming is essential for building responsive and scalable applications. This repository serves as a
playground for experimenting with different asynchronous programming techniques in Java, including CompletableFuture,
reactive programming with Reactor, and asynchronous I/O operations.

## Features

- Examples of asynchronous programming using CompletableFuture.
- Demonstrations of reactive programming with Reactor.
- Benchmarks and performance comparisons of different asynchronous techniques.
- Best practices and tips for writing asynchronous code in Java.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you'll need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
- Apache Maven for building the projects.

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HatimCherkaoui/AsyncExperimental.git
```

## Usage

Each subdirectory in the repository contains a separate project or example demonstrating a specific aspect of
asynchronous programming. Navigate to the desired directory and follow the instructions in the README file to build and
run the code.

## Examples

completable-future-example: Example demonstrating the usage of CompletableFuture for asynchronous programming.
reactor-example: Example showcasing reactive programming with Reactor.
